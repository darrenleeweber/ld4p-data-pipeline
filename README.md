Project Management : https://ld-stanford.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/



Note: The Project depends on BananaRDF. Unfortunately the banana artifacts for the version of Scala we use are not available online.
Hence Banana RDF needs to be cloned, compiled and published locally before compiling this project.

- git clone https://github.com/banana-rdf/banana-rdf

- cd  banana-rdf

- sbt ++2.11.8 publishLocal
